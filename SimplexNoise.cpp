/**
 * @file    SimplexNoise.cpp
 * @brief   A Perlin Simplex Noise C++ Implementation (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D).
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2014 Sebastien Rombauts (sebastien.rombauts@gmail.com)
 *
 * This C++ implementation is based on the speed-improved Java version 2012-03-09
 * by Stefan Gustavson (original Java source code in the public domain).
 * http://webstaff.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/SimplexNoise.java:
 * - Based on example code by Stefan Gustavson (stegu@itn.liu.se).
 * - Optimisations by Peter Eastman (peastman@drizzle.stanford.edu).
 * - Better rank ordering method by Stefan Gustavson in 2012.
 *
 * This implementation is "Simplex Noise" as presented by
 * Ken Perlin at a relatively obscure and not often cited course
 * session "Real-Time Shading" at Siggraph 2001 (before real
 * time shading actually took on), under the title "hardware noise".
 * The 3D function is numerically equivalent to his Java reference
 * code available in the PDF course notes, although I re-implemented
 * it from scratch to get more readable code. The 1D, 2D and 4D cases
 * were implemented from scratch by me from Ken Perlin's text.

/**
 * This method is faster than using (int32_t)std::floor(fp).
 *
 * I measured it to be approximatly twice as fast:
 *  float:  ~18.4ns instead of ~39.6ns on an AMD APU),
 *  double: ~20.6ns instead of ~36.6ns on an AMD APU),
 * Reference: http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/700780/Fast-floor-ceiling-functions

/**
 * Permutation table. This is just a random jumble of all numbers 0-255,
 * repeated twice to avoid wrapping the index at 255 for each lookup.
 * This needs to be exactly the same for all instances on all platforms,
 * so it's easiest to just keep it as static explicit data.
 * This also removes the need for any initialisation of this class.
 *
 * Note that making this an int[] instead of a char[] might make the
 * code run faster on platforms with a high penalty for unaligned single
 * byte addressing. Intel x86 is generally single-byte-friendly, but
 * some other CPUs are faster with 4-aligned reads.
 * However, a char[] is smaller, which avoids cache trashing, and that
 * is probably the most important aspect on most architectures.
 * This array is accessed a *lot* by the noise functions.
 * A vector-valued noise over 3D accesses it 96 times, and a
 * float-valued 4D noise 64 times. We want this to fit in the cache!
